Definition of "casual tone": "A casual tone is a way of writing that conveys informality, relaxation, and a sense of ease. A person writing with a casual tone uses language and intonation that is less formal and more relaxed, conveying a sense of familiarity and comfort. A casual tone can be identified by a number of verbal and nonverbal cues, including:
- Use of informal language and slang
- Use of contractions 
- Use of humor and anecdotes 
- Intonation and tone that is less formal 
Overall, a casual tone communicates a sense of informality and friendliness, which can help establish a more relaxed and comfortable atmosphere in both personal and professional contexts.
